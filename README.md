## My process

### Built with

- Svelte & Vite
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

First proper attempt at writing CSS as 'nice' as possible. I usually overly rely on flexbox and adding `w-full` and `h-full` everywhere. I tried to minimize this.

Turns out this automatically makes it scale for mobile quite well.

Took me a second to figure out how to deploy using github pages, but finally made it work using a nice guide from [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
